## Motivation

I often have the need of adding some sort of admin panel to a project that does not really have any special requirements but it is surprisingly hard to find something that does not contain dozens of npm packages, build steps etc. Hence I made this.

## What is missing?

More pages like login, CRUD table view, etc. this is really super barebones right now but whatever is missing you can probably find on the internet or the bulma documentation.
